G. Questions
Answer the following questions according to the understanding of the material above
1. In Practicum 1 - Step 5, what is the function of the APP_KEY in the Laravel .env setting file?
=> Used for encryption i.e. securing sensitive data such as user sessions, passwords, and cookies

2. In Practicum 1, how do we generate value for APP_KEY?
=> Using php artisan key:generate command.

3. In Practicum 2.1 - Step 1, by default how many migration files does Laravel have? and what are the migration files for?
=> Has 4 migration file, 
1st migration is to create a users table in the database.
2nd migration to create a password_reset_tokens table in the database.  
3th migration to create a failed_jobs table in the database.
4th migration to create a personal_access_tokens table in the database.

4. By default, the migration file contains the code $table->timestamps();, what is the purpose/output of the function?
=> The purposes are to create two columns in database table 'created_at' and 'updated_at' automically

5. In the Migration File, there is a function $table->id(); What type of data does the function return?
=> To create an auto-incrementing primary key columnn in databse table and the data will be unique data

6. What is the difference between the migration results in the m_level table, between using $table->id(); by using $table->id('level_id'); ?
=> The difference is that when we use $table->id();, the column name will be the default 'id' and when using $table->id('level_id');, the column name will be 'level_id' and the function remains the same, which is to create an auto-increment column for the primary key.

7. In migrations, what is the ->unique() function used for?
=>To determine that a column in a database table must have a unique value.

=>If using $table->unsignedBigInteger('level_id') to indicate that it is a foreign key, while $table->id('level_id') to indicate that it is a primary key.
